# ATmega32 Drivers

This project contains a set of drivers for the ATmega32 microcontroller, designed to interface with various peripherals such as **GPIO**, **UART**, **I2C**, **SPI**, and others. These drivers simplify the interaction with the hardware, making it easier to work with the ATmega32 in embedded systems.

## Features

- **GPIO Driver**: For controlling input/output pins.
- **UART Driver**: For serial communication.
- **I2C Driver**: For communication with I2C-based devices.
- **SPI Driver**: For communication with SPI-based devices.
- **ADC Driver**: For reading analog inputs.
- **Timer Driver**: For generating time delays and PWM signals.
- **Interrupt Handling**: For setting up and managing interrupts.
- **ECU Layer Integration**: Facilitates interaction between the MCAL layer and the higher-level application code.

## Requirements

- **ATmega32 microcontroller**.
- **AVR-GCC toolchain** or **Atmel Studio** for building the code.
- **Hardware (optional)**: Suitable ATmega32 development board for testing.
